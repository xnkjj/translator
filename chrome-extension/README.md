# Simple Translate

This is a Google Chrome extension that is currently waiting for release.

How to use it?

When browsing a webpage, if you encounter English worlds or others that you cannot understand, select it, right-click, and choose [Translate Selected Text]. At this point, the program will send the selected text with default or customized prompt to Gemini API. When a result is returned, the program will insert a modal in the webpage you are browsing, and the content of the modal will be the response from Gemini API.
